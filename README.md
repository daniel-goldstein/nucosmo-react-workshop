# NUCoSMO React Workshop

## Environment Setup
1. First thing to do is make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Next, open up a Terminal window and in your favorite directory run

    ```bash
    > npm install -g create-react-app
    ```

2. When that's done, run

    ```bash
    > create-react-app first-project
    > cd first-project
    > npm start
    ```

You just made a website! It might not do much and only be accessible on your own computer but ya know, baby steps. If you open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:3000` (if it did not automatically open one for you), you should see the lovely React template page.

What you really did there was used `create-react-app` to set up all the boilerplate of a React application that we decided to call `first-project` and started the development server. We'll keep this running in the background so that our local website can update in real-time as we change files.
