# NUCoSMO React Workshop

## Environment Setup
1. First thing to do is make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Next, open up a Terminal window and in your favorite directory run

    ```> npm install -g create-react-app```

2. When that's done, run

    ```> create-react-app first-project```
    
    ```> cd first-project```
    
    ```> npm start```

You just made a website! It might not do much and only be accessible on your own computer but ya know, baby steps. If you open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:3000` (if it did not automatically open one for you), you should see the lovely React template page.
